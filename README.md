# Welcome to Auto News Checker
## About
For our project, we want to build a Chrome extension that can determine whether a news source is fake or true, using machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI). Before building the extension, we must build the model first.

First, we sourced our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification) from Kaggle. Then, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts to clean and process the written data into numerical forms understood by computers. Finally, we trained and tested a couple of machine learning models, to see which works best in classifying news:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayer Classifier
3. Passive Aggressive Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine

From our evaluation, we found that support vector machine model works best. Therefore, we will be using this model for our Chrome extension. The detailed workthrough on how we trained our model can be found here.
